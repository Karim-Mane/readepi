## importing data from excel file with 2 sheets
here we are importing from the second excel sheet
```{r eval=FALSE}
file = "/Users/karimmane/Documents/Karim/LSHTM/Data/For_correlation.xlsx"

# Reading data from relational database management systems (RDBMS): HDSS, EMRS, REDCap
## importing data from RDBMS into R
### importing from REDCap
we were given access to the **Pats__Covid_19_Cohort_1_Screening**.    
```{r eval=FALSE}

project.data = data$data
project.metadeta = data$metadata

# reading specified fields and all records from the project
fields = c("day_1_q_ran_id","redcap_event_name","day_1_q_1a","day_1_q_1b","day_1_q_1c","day_1_q_1","day_1_q_2","day_1_q_3","day_1_q_4","day_1_q_5")

```

### importing from HDSS or EMRS
we were given access to the **IBS_BHDSS** database.   
```{r eval=FALSE}

# reading specified fields and all records from the table
data = readepi(credentials.file, project.id="IBS_BHDSS", driver.name = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server", table.name = "dss_events", fields = fields)

# reading specified records and all fields from the table
data = readepi(credentials.file, project.id="IBS_BHDSS", driver.name = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server", table.name = "dss_events", records = records)

# reading specified fields and records from the table
